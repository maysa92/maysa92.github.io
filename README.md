I am backed by years of design working experience and a bachelor in design. This is the portfolio website where I keep some of my artworks as a student and freelancer for Taiwanese small companies and start-ups. I have experience using WordPress and Wix.com to build websites, while I feel it could help me understand website technologies deeper if I write one by myself.
